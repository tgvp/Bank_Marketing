# Bank Marketing Analysis

The goal of this project is performing the data analysis getting insights from the data, classifying it making a customer segmentation to discover which kind of customers subscribe term deposits.

This project currently includes:

* Data Wrangling
* Customer Segmentation using the K-Means (Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm).
* Logistic Regression to predict term-deposit subscriptions

This is a ongoing project where some of techniques studied during the Fisrt Semester of the Master Degree in Data Science (Fall/Winter 2022) are applied.

* K-Means: It is a Unsupervised Learning Algorithm that partitions the data clustering it into "k" distinct clusters grouped around centroids.

* Logistic Regression: Statistical model that predicts the probability of an event taking place or not.

## Libraries used:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Networkx
* Built-in python libs
